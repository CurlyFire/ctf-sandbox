## Background Context
This is a TDD Sandbox to work out the kinks to migrate from a big ball of mud legacy project to a microservice hexagonal architecture with unit tests that respect the modern test pyramid.

The main goals of this project are:
- âœ… Generate a big ball of mud to represent the initial legacy application
- ðŸ”„ Migrate to a microservices hexagonal architecture with unit tests
- ðŸ”„ Get my DDD Bounded Contexts framed correctly
- ðŸ”„ Develop all this code in TDD, following [Valentina Jemuovic's](https://github.com/valentinajemuovic) suggested way.  Her site is [Optivem journal](https://journal.optivem.com).  You can also follow her on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valentinajemuovic)

The big ball of mud was created with github copilot agent mode using Claude Sonnet 3.5.  I just wanted to create something that worked without being clean.
